# ðŸŒŸ Simon SlÃ¡dek â€“ Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio.  
Here I showcase my work in **bioinformatics, data analysis, and project development**.  
This repository serves as a **central hub** for my professional journey â€“ from scientific case studies to building innovative platforms.

## ðŸ”¬ Bioinformatics Case Studies
Hands-on projects demonstrating my ability to analyze, interpret, and visualize biological data:

- **[RNA-seq Case Study](https://github.com/SimonSladek/rna-seq-case-study)**  
  End-to-end workflow: QC (FastQC), alignment (STAR), counting (featureCounts), and differential expression analysis (DESeq2).

- **[Variant Calling Pipeline](link)**  
  Processing whole-genome data: alignment, variant detection, and annotation.

- **[Protein Analysis Tools](link)**  
  Sequence alignment and homology search (BLAST, HMMER).
